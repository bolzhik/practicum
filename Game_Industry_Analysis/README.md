## Project description

Public sources contain information such as the historical data of game sales, scores of users and experts, genres, and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation). We can find out the features which determine a game's success. This will help to bet on a potentially popular product and plan an advertising campaign.

We have the data until 2016. Imagine it's December of 2016 and we are planning the 2017 campaign.

In the dataset, there is an abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) which is an association for determining the age group of computer games. ESRB evaluates game content and assigns a suitable age category, e.g. "Adults Only 18+ (AO)", "Everyone (E)", "Teen (T)", etc.
